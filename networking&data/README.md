# README NETWORKING
- This folder contains some network security projects, including two small data science internship codes on analyzing PDF text and a RAG pipeline.
- My understanding of TCP/IP is fairly standard/fundamental and based around the TCP/IP (5-layer) model. This semester I have progressed through networking attack labs using Docker containers on Ubuntu, and am currently working on an another sniff/spoofing lab (TBD March 8th). I am concurrently also completing a Qualys vulnerability assesment badge.
- Commonly used infrastructure/software in these projects include Wireshark and Ubuntu.
