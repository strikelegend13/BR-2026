# README NETWORKING
- This folder contains primarily networking projects, including two small data science internproject on analyzing PDF text. My understanding of TCP/IP is fairly standard and based around the TCP/IP (5-layer) model. This semester I have progressed some networking attack labs, and am currently working on an another sniff/spoofing lab (TBD March 8th). I am concurrently also completing a Qualys vulnerability assesment badge.
- Common stack in these projects include Wireshark and Ubuntu.
