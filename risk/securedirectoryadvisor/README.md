As soon as the app is running, it silently watches your Downloads folder. When any new file appears, it pops up a friendly notification asking if you'd like it checked.

# HIGHLY RECOMMENED: Extra Protection with API Keys

For even stronger checking, you can add free API keys from:

- **VirusTotal** (https://www.virustotal.com) — checks files against 70+ antivirus engines
- **Google Safe Browsing** (https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing) — checks URLs against Google's database of dangerous sites

Both have free tiers sufficient for personal use. Add them in the Settings panel.
